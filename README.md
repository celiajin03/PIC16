# PIC16

This repository contains my programming projects for an "Python with Applications" course, which covers a variety of Python topics including text processing (RegEx), numerical algorithms, image processing (noise/blur/edge detection), file I/O, GUI creation (TkInter), and natural language processing (NLTK).


## Programming Projects
Each programming project is contained in a separate folder in this repository, and includes the relevant code and any associated data files. The projects are:

* Project 1: [Python Basics](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW1)
* Project 2: [Numerical Algorithms](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW2)
* Project 3: [LinkedList](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW3)
* Project 4: [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW4)
* Project 5: [Image Processing I](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW5)
* Project 6: [Image Processing II](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW6)
* Project 7: [GUI - Knight's Tour Puzzle Game](https://github.com/celiajin03/PIC16/tree/main/HW7)
